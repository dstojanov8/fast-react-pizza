## Configure eslint

1. Run: `npm i eslint vite-plugin-eslint eslint-config-react-app --save-dev`
2. Create: `.eslintrc.json` and add `{ "extends": "react-app" }`
3. Check `vite.config.js` on how to configure eslint (we will comment it out for now)

**In this project, and likely all the following, we don't need to do this as we do have `.eslintrc.cjs` configured but do check!**
