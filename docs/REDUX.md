For **_Global App State_** we use _Redux_ with _Redux Toolkit_. For this we created a `store.js` and added a **Provider** in `main.jsx`. It the store we added the **User Reducer** we created in `userSlce.js`, check _userSlice_ file to see _reducers_ and _actions_. In `Cart.jsx`, `CreateOrder.jsx`, `CreateUser.jsx`, `Username.jsx` and `Home.jsx` we use _useSelector_ or _useDispatch_ to interact with the store.
